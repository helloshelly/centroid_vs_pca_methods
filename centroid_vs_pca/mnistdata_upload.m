% A simple to identify a test digit is to compare its 
% pixels to those in each row of T and determine which row
% most closely resembles the test digit

% A more sophisticated approach is the PCA, which attempts
% to identify characteristic properties of each digit, based
% on trhe training data, and the compare these properties with 
% those of the test digit in order to make an identification
