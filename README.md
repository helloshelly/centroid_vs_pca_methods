# centroid_vs_pca_methods
Study on the Classic Pattern Recognition Problem using Centroid Method and Principal Component Analysis Method

The mathematical problem of this report is the comparison between the centroid method and the principal component analysis method when used to solve a pattern recognition problem. Our chosen solution is the principal component analysis because it performed better than the centroid method, and this is because computing a solution based on the variation determined by the orthogonal basis vectors was much better than simply taking the Euclidean distance between the mean of a trained digit and the given digit. The PDF report will go into more detail of our findings.
